### Lambda Usage :
  * We use Lambda to trigger an event by upload image or folder using AWS s3. 
  * To see the event : 
    1. monitor
    2. view console cloudWatch
    3. log streams
    4. go to last one which is your event

### Issues:
  * I can't start the code and see result and can't deploy it.
